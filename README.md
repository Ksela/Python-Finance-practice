# Python-Finance-practice
In this repository I will be placing all my practice with python that involves finance related topics. 

The files that are created and placed here are heavily influenced by Sentdex's tutorials on how to make graphs and other financial programs. As a result some graphs will probably look the same as those in his tutorials.
